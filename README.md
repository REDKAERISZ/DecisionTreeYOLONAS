# Decision Tree for YOLONAS hyperparameters 

## Description
The purpose of the code in this repository is to find the most relevant hyperparameters when training a YOLONAS based model on a medical dataset such as mammography or cervical imaging 
and therefore, finding the best combination of these to improve the robustness of the detection algorithm for key features in medical imaging.
